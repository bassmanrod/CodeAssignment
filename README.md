## This is a menu driven Perl script that will parse the access_log provided by the interviewer.

## Please place this menu.pl file (sorry, I should be descriptive in the name) in a directory.
## Please place the 'access_log' in the same directory

USAGE:
./menu.pl

## You may need to install two cpan modules: 'Switch' and 'Socket' -- it will error out if it can't find it.
## https://metacpan.org/pod/Switch
## https://metacpan.org/pod/Socket

## This has been tested on a MAC OSX only
