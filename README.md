This was a code assignment from an interview I had with Amazon (by the way I passed the code assignment :-)

This is a menu driven Perl script that will parse the access_log provided by the interviewer.

Please place this menu.pl file (sorry, I should be descriptive in the name) in a directory.
Please place the 'access_log' in the same directory

USAGE:
./menu.pl

You may need to install two cpan modules: 'Switch' and 'Socket' -- it will error out if it can't find it.
If you are on a Debian, simply type 'cpan' as root on the command line and issue the following command
without the quotes 'install Switch'.


This has been tested on a MAC OSX only
